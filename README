Some docs, about programming with C.
Compiled them here together for convenience,
and converted them to other formatings.

The man pages in bsd-libc/man are from freeBSD,
(BSD-License).
I converted them to .rst.

The other docs are collected from the web,
I've pointed the sources out.

Mainly I try to sort these information for my own,
but possibly it's also of use for others.

I did have these documentation originally within the minilib git,
but uploading a huge bunch of documentation into a "mini"-lib repository
doesn't seem so wise.
