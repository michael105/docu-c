ACL_STRIP_NP(3) BSD Library Functions Manual ACL_STRIP_NP(3)

**NAME**

**acl_is_trivial_np** — determine whether ACL is trivial

**LIBRARY**

Standard C Library (libc, −lc)

**SYNOPSIS**

**#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/acl.h>**

*int*

**acl_is_trivial_np**\ (*const acl_t aclp*, *int *trivialp*);

**DESCRIPTION**

The **acl_is_trivial**\ () function determines whether the ACL pointed
to by the argument *acl* is trivial. Upon successful completion, the
location referred to by the argument *trivialp* will be set to 1, if the
ACL *aclp* points to is trivial, or 0 if it’s not.

ACL is trivial if it can be fully expressed as a file mode without
losing any access rules. For POSIX.1e ACLs, ACL is trivial if it has the
three required entries, one for owner, one for owning group, and one for
other. For NFSv4 ACLs, ACL is trivial if it is identical to the ACL
generated by **acl_strip_np**\ (*3*). Files that have non-trivial ACL
have a plus sign appended after mode bits in "ls -l" output.

**RETURN VALUES**

The **acl_get_tag_type**\ () function returns the value 0 if successful;
otherwise the value −1 is returned and the global variable *errno* is
set to indicate the error.

**STANDARDS**

POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17. Discussion of the draft
continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation mailing list. To
join this list, see the FreeBSD POSIX.1e implementation page for more
information.

**HISTORY**

POSIX.1e support was introduced in FreeBSD 4.0. The
**acl_is_trivial_np**\ () function was added in FreeBSD 8.0.
